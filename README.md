For Part A of this project, you will need to implement the PersonType Class. Make sure you follow the same format discussed in class by having an .h file and .cpp file


PersonType class


Member Variables:
A person’s first name
fName
stored as a string


A person’s last name
lName
stored as a string


A person’s social security number
SSN
stored as an int


Default
Constructors:
Initializes the social security number to a default value of 0. (why there is no need to initialize the first and last names?)


Overloaded Constructor
Parameters:
first name, last name, and social security


number.


Initializes all member variables to the give values.


Function
setPerfonInfo
Parameters:
first name, last name, and social security


number.


Re-sets the first name, the last name, and the social


security number of a person to the new values passed.


Function:
getFirstName
Returns the person’s first name


Function:
getLastName
Returns the person’s last name


Function:
getSSN
Returns the person’s social security number.


Function:
printName
Prints the person’s last and first name in the following


format:


lName, fName


Function
: printPersonInfo
Calls the function printSSN() to format the social security number. Prints the person’s social security number, first name and last name in the following format


###-##-#### fName lName


Function:
printSSN
Formats the social security number by separating the number with dashes and outputs the formatted string.


Destructor
Left empty


Student Government President Election Results Software Application: 
According to Wikipedia, a student government president is the highest-ranking officer of a student union. Student performing in this role typically serves a ceremonial and managerial purpose. 
The president’s duties and powers arediverse.

To elect a new president for their student government in Orange County,fourcommunity colleges will participate in the election process, namely:
1.
Santiago Canyon College
2.
Santa Ana College
3.
Orange Coast College
4.
Coastline Community College

Students who wish to run for presidency, will pursue students form the above colleges to vote for them.
As a software engineering team, you are invited to design, create, implement, and test an application that will display the election results. 
As of now the specifications of the project are still fluid and keep changing daily as the four community colleges are trying to agree on the full functionality of the application.
Therefore, this project will have several parts.
Your software engineering team will need to fully implement each part before working on the next one. 
Please note that there are multiple software engineering teams who are competing to provide the best application. 
As a matter of fact, there will be a prize for the top three applications.
Software engineering teams will be formed from the two sections of CMPR-121.
We expect to have a list of the all participating teams very soon
